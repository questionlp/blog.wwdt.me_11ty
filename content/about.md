# About

Welcome to the archived version of the Wait Wait Stats Project blog. This blog had previously been used to detail work on the [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) and related sites.

The content of this site was ported over from the previously WordPress-powered blog, with some updates to fix broken links, update links to personal tweets to my [tweet archive](https://tweets.linh.social/), and fix some issues with formatting.

All new development updates are now being posted on my personal blog at [blog.linh.social](https://blog.linh.social).

I occasionally post updates on my two primary social media accounts:

* **Mastodon:** <a href="https://linh.social/@qlp" rel="me">@qlp@linh.social</a>
* **Bluesky:** [@linh.social](https://bsky.app/profile/linh.social)
