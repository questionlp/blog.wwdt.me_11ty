As [previously noted]({{ "/2007/07/wwdtm/" | url }}), I am an avid fan of NPR's weekly quiz show [Wait, Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org) (although some may call it a mini-obsession).

With that _mini-obsession_, I have built a database of various information and statistics about the each show, panelists and guests, and built a [web page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) that presents the collected information and generated statistics.

So far, I have entered in some information for shows since the beginning of 2005 and am continually adding more panelist and guest scores as time allows. I am also including quick summaries and notes for each show and my rating of each show (on a scale of 10, 1 being "Meh, not my thing" and 10 being "Freaking rocks!!!").

Feel free to peruse and submit any questions, corrections and comments to this blog post.
