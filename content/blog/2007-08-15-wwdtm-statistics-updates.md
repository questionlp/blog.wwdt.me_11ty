Over the past two weeks, I have finished entering panelist and guest scores for all of the 2005 "[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org/)" shows. Also, bar graphs have been added in the "Panelist Statistics" section to show the distribution of scores for each panelist. The updates are available at the [WWDTM: Show Details and Statistics](https://stats.wwdt.me/) page.

I am now in the process of filling out show breakdown and notes for the 2005 shows. Once that I have finished with that, I will start to add information about the 2004 shows.

**_[2007-09-12]_ Update:** show descriptions have been entered for all but a few of the 2005 shows and I am now moving on to 2004. The basic data structures for 2003 has already been put into place, with 2000-2002 to follow in the next couple of weeks.
