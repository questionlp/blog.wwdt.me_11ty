It has been a while since I've checked out how well my site has faired on Google using their Webmaster Tools webapp. So it was surprising to see a link back to my [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! statistics page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) from a [blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20101126041512/http://petersagal.com/wordpress/?p=134) by the host of [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](http://waitwait.npr.org/), Peter Sagal... from two years ago!

In his blog post, Peter wrote:

All I can say about this is: "woot!". This is enough to make up for not getting Carl Kasell's message on my voicemail last year (as noted in an [earlier post]({{ "/2009/04/no-carl-kasell-on-my-voicemail/" | url }})).
