Another night, another perusal of website statistics collected by Google, and another mention of my [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Statistics](https://stats.wwdt.me/) page by Peter Sagal. This time, it was a [Twitter reply](http://twitter.com/petersagal/status/25717751639) to another user (granted, I don't usually frequent Twitter unless something is of interest):

As a Wait Wait fan... w00t! I'm glad that my obsession is paying off and it is useful to all of the other Wait Wait fans out there.
