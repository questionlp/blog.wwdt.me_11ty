On this week's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, there was a three-way tie between Peter Grosz, Kyrie O'Connor and Mo Rocca at the end of the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round. Mo asked when was the last time there was a three-way tie.

Well, looking at the statistics that I have been collecting, it was on [2008-09-27](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2008/9/27); where, Mo Rocca, Kyrie O'Connor and Tom Bodett tied with 14 points each.

You're welcome, Mo. :)
