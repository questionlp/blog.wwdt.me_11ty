When I got home tonight, I saw a package that was addressed from [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](http://waitwait.npr.org/) an [Chicago Public Radio](http://wbez.org/) in the pile of today's mail. Within the package was a CD with an audio track containing the greeting that I requested Carl to record for me. Below is the picture of the CD that I received:

![Recordable Compact Disc with "Carl Voicemail for Linh Pham" written](/images/2011/06/IMAG0012_Cropped.jpg)

The following is the text of the greeting that I requested:

> Good day, I am Carl Kasell and you have reached the mailbox for Linh Pham. Linh is probably too busy geeking out or is out somewhere making a fool of himself. Just joking, okay maybe not. Please leave a message after the beep.

Simple and reflects my quirky and ackward mannerisms :)

Thank you, Carl, for recording the greeting!
