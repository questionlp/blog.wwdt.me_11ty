As noted in the original "[Wait Wait Stats Update: 1998]({{ "/2011/05/wait-wait-stats-updates-1998/" | url }})" post, my goal was to complete filling out the panelists, guests and descriptions for all of 1998 by the end of June. Well, it's now 1 July 2011 and I still haven't gotten all of the show descriptions filled out. At least I have the guests entered in (without scores).

What I was able to do before the end of June was to add one of the features that I had been thinking about doing (and some have been asking for). If you visit the [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), you will notice that all of the show dates are now links. When you click on the link, it will send you over to that show's specific page on [NPR.org](http://www.npr.org/). That way, you can view the transcripts for the newer shows, listen to a segment or the entire show, or figure out what song was used as an inter-segment button.

I am still thinking of the cleanest way of storing and presenting the location of where each show was recorded. Before that can happen, I will need to rewrite the code that handles the data query and processing of that data, before generating it for display. That rewrite should also open up the ability to display the breakdown of the panelist points and who had the correct bluff.

**Update [2011-07-02]:** I have made a couple of tweaks to the panelist scoring graph to make it a bit easier to quickly determine how many times a panelist has scored _x_ points.
