During the second panelist round of Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! that [aired the weekend of 2011-06-18](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2011/6/18), the discussion lead to Mo Rocca saying that having a Hula dancer in the same room as a mother giving birth would help the mother relax. This led to Luke Burbank asking if this would be blogged on "Mo Rocca, The World's Worst Obstetrician dot net".

I didn't get to listen to that segment until several days later and noticed that the [MoRoccaTheWorldsWorstObstetrician.net](http://MoRoccaTheWorldsWorstObstetrician.net) domain [had not been taken... yet](https://tweets.linh.social/84776111585767425/). So, I decided to [register the domain](https://tweets.linh.social/84845838110695424/) and set up the site to redirect to my [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! statistics page](https://stats.wwdt.me/).

Well, this week's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! show was all about listener favorite segments and requests. Many of the listeners wanted a lot of Mo Rocca moments, but Peter and Carl included Mo Rocca's Hula dancer moment. Peter then [added](http://www.npr.org/2011/08/27/139980804/mo-moments):

> A note to that story. You may know that a listener named Linh Pham keeps a detailed archive of past Wait Wait episodes. Shortly after that question aired back in June, Linh registered "Mo Rocca, the world's worst obstetrician dot net" as a website and it takes you to the Wait Wait archive.

Yep, got another mention on Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!; and as a fan of Wait Wait, that's pretty darn awesome.
