Up until now, there was no way to create a link that goes to a certain show on the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me statistics page. Instead, you would have to go the page and scroll down or search for the show's date. Now, you can create links that refers to a specific show's entry.

To link to a specific entry, you can use the following URL template:

> `http://wwdt.me/stats/#s<YYYYMMDD>`

Replace `<YYYYMMDD>` with the show's four digit year, two digit month and two digit day. For example, to create a link that points to the spot for the April 23, 2011 show, the URL you would use is:

> <http://wwdt.me/stats/#s20110423>

I know, it's a small update, but I hope someone finds it useful. :)
