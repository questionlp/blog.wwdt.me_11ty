When the latest version of the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Statistics Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) gets published later today, you might notice a couple of new additions. The one that that I have finished implementing is displaying the percentage of appearances that each panelist has gotten first, tied for first, second, tied for second and third place. This should be a better indicator on how well a panelist has done based on how often their appeared on the show.

The other additions to the page hint at an upcoming feature that I am currently coding up: statistics for both the show hosts and scorekeepers. At this point, I'm not sure exactly what statistics will be displayed. I don't have a timeline on when I will have the new feature ready for release.
