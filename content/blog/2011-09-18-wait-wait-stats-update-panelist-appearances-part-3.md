I have finished entering in all of the panelist appearances into the database for the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/). Unfortunately, the panelist scores are still void since that data will have to be collected and entered through other means.

It is also unfortunate that a lot of the earlier show audio is no longer available through the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! archives, so I will need to figure out other means to procure that information.

Next up? I'm going to try to finish filling in the Not My Job guest appearances.
