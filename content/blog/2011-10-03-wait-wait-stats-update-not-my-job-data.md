I have finished entering the list of Not My Job guests into the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) database; although, I have not included any guest scores as that will be a nice process of listening to the older shows.

I am now working on adding in show descriptions for shows, filling the void between 2000 and 2004. This process will probably take a couple of weeks to complete. Thankfully, it isn't quite as tedious as entering in the list of Not My Job guests. Please note that I am basing the show descriptions on what is listed in the show archives on NPR.org, so the level of detail may vary dramatically.

Once that has been completed, I will work on filling in the data for shows prior to 2000. It's just easier to do it in chunks, particularly when the really early show information pages aren't as easy to parse.
