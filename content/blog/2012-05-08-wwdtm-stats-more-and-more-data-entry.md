It's been a while since I've blogged about updates to the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), but I have been making a little bit more progress on a couple of things.

First thing is that I have been able to locate MP3s of Wait Wait shows from early 2003 through early 2006, stopping where the first show was made available as a podcast. My goal is to listen through each show and fill in scores and other information that is currently missing.

Along with that, I will be entering in not only which panelist had the correct bluff, but also the panelist that the listener chose. Once I get that information entered, I will find a way to display both on the page.

Next, I have been slowly collecting where the show has been recorded and will be entering that into the database as well. I will also have to figure out how to display that on the page.

I will also be working on filling out the panelist scores when they start the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round and how many they got correct. This will eventually make it on to the page as well.

In the meantime, I will be working on building up a new version of the site. I've got a basic mock-up built, but it isn't quite ready to be made public... yet :)
