During the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank (LFinB) round for the [16 June 2012](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2012/6/16) show, Maz Jobrani had answered six questions correctly (as confirmed by Peter saying yes, correct or right six times and by the six dings). Unfortunately, Carl only noted that Maz Jobrani had five correct answers for 10 more points for a total of 13 points.

If you check out the [show's transcript](http://www.npr.org/2012/06/16/155151727/lightning-fill-in-the-blank) for the LFitB round, you will notice that there are six "(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)" listed for Maz's portion of the round.

Due to the miscount of correct answers, Maz Jobrani ended up being second rather than tying with Amy Dickinson, who also had and was credited for 6 correct answers, for first place.

Until Peter and/or Carl officially correct the record, the stats page will show the current official scores and rankings. Once the record has been corrected, I will update the stats page to reflect that. My guess is that Maz will be afforded the same "win" pass the next time he is on the show, just like when the same thing happened to Paula Poundstone (robbed two points on the [2007-09-01](https://stats.wwdt.me/2007/9/1) show and got a "win" pass on the [2007-09-22](https://stats.wwdt.me/2007/9/22) show).
