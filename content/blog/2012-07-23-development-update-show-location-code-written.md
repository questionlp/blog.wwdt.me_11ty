Over the past week, I have been working on the last remaining pieces of the new Stats Page and its underlying database structure. Well, I have finally finished writing up the code to grab and display the location in which shows are recorded at. I still have not entered any real data for it yet; but, it is ready for when I am able to get that data in.

To verify that I have the code working, I wired it up to the test script that I have been using. The following is a snippet from that script's output. Note the field called "Show Location".

I still haven't had a chance to work on the web presentation layer yet.
