I have finished entering in show descriptions for all Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! shows from the very beginning up to the latest show; as well as, going back and cleaning up the description for the earliest shows.

The next set of statistics that I will start collecting and entering are the Not My Job and panelist scores for the shows that I have audio for. I will work on collecting Bluff the Listener information as well. The latter will be displayed in the next version of the [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/).
