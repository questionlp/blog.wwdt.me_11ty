Ever wonder when was the last time that a panelist came in first place or tied for first after the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank on Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!? Right now, the current version of the [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) does not include that information in the "Panelists Statistics" section of the page; but, it is something that I am planning on adding to the next version of the page.

Until then, you can use this page to view that information, which will be updated periodically.

The data in the above tables were last updated on 2014-01-14 and does not include ties. If a panelist does not appear in either table, it means that that panelists never came in first or tied for first after the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round.
