The news that Carl Kasell will be [hanging up his Wait Wait scorekeeper's hat this Spring](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/285327851/carl-kasell-to-retire-from-wait-wait-dont-tell-me-this-spring) hit me like a brick wall. Carl has been the scorekeeper and the magical voice of all of the winning listener contestant's voice mail greetings ever since the sho [started over 16 years ago](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/1998/1/3).

I have had the honor to have met and chatted with Carl Kasell twice, once when Wait Wait was in [Portland back in September 2011](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2011/9/17)Â and again [in Chicago back in July 2012](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/7/28). In addition to getting to meet Carl Kasell twice, I also won a [message recorded by Carl]({{ "/2011/06/the-voice-of-carl-kasell-has-arrived/" | url}}) when [I was on the show as a listener contestant](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2011/4/23).

I really hope to have the chance to attend one of the celebration shows, either in Chicago or in Washington DC, to say thank you and salute Carl.
