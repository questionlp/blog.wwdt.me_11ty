Just a quick blog post... I am very excited, and a wee bit sad, that I will be going to Carl Kasell's lastÂ taping of Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in Washington DC on May 15th. The live taping will be held at the Warner Theatre at 7:30 PM Eastern Time.

If any of you guys will be at the live taping and want to meet up before the show, just send a tweet to [@questionlp](https://tweets.linh.social/) <del>or contact me using the site's Contact Me form</del>.
