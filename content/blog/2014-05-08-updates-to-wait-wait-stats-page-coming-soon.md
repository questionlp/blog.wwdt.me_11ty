During the weekend of May 17th and 18th, I will be rolling out a few updates to the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), on the heels of coming back from Carl Kasell's scorekeeper finale in Washington DC.

The updates to the site will include adding a new graph for each of the panelists. I won't spill all of the details, but below is a sneak peek at what the graph would look like, without obfuscations of course.
