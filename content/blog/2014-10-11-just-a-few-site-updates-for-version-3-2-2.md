Over the past several weeks, I have been testing out a few minor updates to the panelist statistics presentation and adding a few additional statistics. When the latest version of the site was launched, each panelist had their lowest, highest and average score listed in their stats information box (as shown below).

The updated panelist stats information box not only uses more common statistical names (min, max and mean), I have now included the population standard deviation of the panelist's scores and the sum of all of the panelists scores.

<del>The other minor addition to the site is the search page that allows you to search the site by way of a customized Google search. The link to the search page is found in the upper-left corner of the page and can also be reached via [this link](https://stats.wwdt.me/search).</del>
