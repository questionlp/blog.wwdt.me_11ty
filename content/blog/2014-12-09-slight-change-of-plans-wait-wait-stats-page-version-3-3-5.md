As mentioned in the [last blog post]({{ "/2014/11/working-on-wait-wait-stats-page-versions-3-3-0-and-3-4-0/" | url }}) about upcoming developments for the [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), version 3.4.0 would be introducing both a new set of stats and graphs. In addition, version 3.4.0 would also include the descriptions that judge and scorekeeper Bill Kurtis uses to introduce himself at the beginning of each show.

Due to unforeseen complexities of feeding the queried data into the appropriate graphing functions, I will be releasing version 3.3.5 this weekend that will include Bill Kurtis's descriptions in each of the show's infobox.
