A couple of months ago, [Erin Flachsbart](http://mataglap.com/) sent me a message asking if I would be interested in helping out a project that she would like to start up. The project was to create an interactive infographic that was based on the [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!](http://waitwait.npr.org) panelist and show stats that I have been collecting (and continuing to collect) over the years.

Over the course of the project, I provided Erin with database schema and database backups that she can go through and play with the data. I also provided some insights, and apologies for not having a lot of back data on panelist bluffs and show location information.

With the project completed, Erin posted the awesome interactive infographic on her site at: [mataglap.com/waitwait](http://mataglap.com/wwdtm/).

I'm humbled to be able to assist in providing data and insights for the project. Thanks [Erin](https://bsky.app/profile/wardepartment.bsky.social)!
