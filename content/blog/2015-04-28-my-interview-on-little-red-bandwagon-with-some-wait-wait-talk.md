In addition to running the [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!](http://waitwait.npr.org) [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), I also run and manage an archive of sorts for (Wait Wait panelist) Luke Burbank's podcast, [Too Beautiful to Live](https://tbtl.net), called the "[Marsupial Gurgle](http://marsupialgurgle.com)" ([it's a TBTL in-joke](http://marsupialgurgle.com/andrew-marsupial-gurgle-sound/)).

With the recent re-launch of the Marsupial Gurgle archive, I was invited to be on a guest on a podcast about TBTL called, [Little Red Bandwagon](https://web.archive.org/web/20170712215547/http://www.tenseventen.com/show/little-red-bandwagon). As part of being a guest on the podcast, the topic of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! came up and I discussed some of the behind the scenes bits regarding scoring and what-not.

My segment on the show starts at around the 1:16:15 mark of the episode named, "[Bully For You: Soy Sauce & Lake Rocks](https://archive.org/details/little-red-bandwagon-podcast-archive/Episode+005-Bully+For+You-+Soy+Sauce+%26+Lake+Rocks.mp3)".

_nb:_ The original website and podcast feed for "Little Red Bandwagon" is no longer available. All episodes of the podcast are have been updated to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/little-red-bandwagon-podcast-archive).
