After Roxanne Roberts smoked through all 8 of the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank questions on the Wait Wait show that aired during the weekend of 2015-06-06, Bill Kurtis mentioned that he has not witness such a feat since he's become the official scorekeeper for Wait Wait in the past year.

Although it is not common for a panelist to answer all eight Lightning round questions correctly, it has happened a number of times in the past few years. To be exactly, panelists have answered eight Lightning round questions correctly 15 times since 2010-01-01. Of those, Roxanne accomplished that feat 5 times. So, I decided to run a few queries against the Wait Wait Stats Page database and found that, since Bill Kurtis as become the official scorekeeper, no panelists have answered eight correctly in a single round. So, Bill Kurtis is correct with his qualified statement.

Having said that, if you widen the scope further and see if Bill Kurtis has seen any panelist answer all eight Lightning round questions correctly in one show, it indeed happened. In fact, it was none other than Roxanne Roberts who smoked P.J. O'Rourke and (coincidentally) Tom Bodett back on the show that aired just about two years before this past weekend on 2013-06-08.

To summarize, Bill Kurtis was correct when he stated that he hadn't seen particular panelist answer all 8 of the Lightning round questions correctly in one shot (until now) since becoming the official judge and scoreekeeper of Wait Wait; but, if you include Bill's tenure as guest judge and scorekeeper, he has witnessed Roxanne doing that feat just two years before.
