It all started over seven years ago when I sent in an e-mail to Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! asking if I could be a listener contestant and that it would make for an awesome birthday present and added a small note about my Wait Wait Stats Page. I later found out that I was selected to be the listener contestant for the Not My Job round when Monica Seles was on as the guest back in 2009. Unfortunately, [she kind of goose egged](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2009/4/25) and [I didn't get to win Carl Kasell's voicemail message]({{ "/2009/04/no-carl-kasell-on-my-voicemail/" | url }}).

Fast forwarding to April 2011, I got a call from one of the Wait Wait producers who asked me I wanted to be a listener contestant on the coming week's taping. The producer kind of felt bad about the whole Monica Seles not scoring well on the game. So, I accepted the offer and was lined up to be the first listener contestant on the show that taped exactly five years ago today, April 21, 2011, and later [aired on my birthday](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/23/135656298/whos-carl-this-time). You can listen to the segment below:

I'm not sure how much of it was reflected in my voice or mannerisms, or muted by the not-so-great headset I was using, but I had a strong mix of nervousness, anxiety, excitement and tiredness coursing through me. By the end of the segment, I had done enough to get [Carl Kasell to record a voicemail message for me]({{ "/2011/06/the-voice-of-carl-kasell-has-arrived/" | url }}):

Although I haven't deployed Carl's message on a voicemail device, it still is nice to have a small piece of Carl's voice to call my own.
