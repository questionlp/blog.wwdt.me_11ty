On the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! show that aired on 2016-06-11, Bill Kurtis made a statement at the beginning of the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank round stating that, for the first time in his tenure, that all three panelists were tied going into the Lightning round. The claim that it was the first time in his tenure as official judge and scorekeeper caused all of the mental alarms to go off. I knew that Bill has made that statement in the past and remembered that [I wrote about it when happened, all the way back in 2015-08-01]({{ "/2015/08/factcheck-first-three-way-tie-going-into-lightning-round/" | url }}).

In that blog post, I found that it had already happened two times, [2015-02-28](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2015/2/28) and [2013-03-09](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2013/3/9), while Bill Kurtis was judge and scorekeeper. Of the four total times there has been a three-way tie going into the Lightning round with Bill Kurtis was judge and scorekeeper, Brian Babylon was on the panel three times and Faith Salie twice; both of which, were on the [2016-06-11](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/2016/6/11) show.

I'm not sure if it was discussed during the taping of the live show and edited out; but, I wonder if Brian Babylon and Faith Salie any thoughts or comments about it.
