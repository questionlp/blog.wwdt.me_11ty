After spending a few hours listening to the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! audio archive that I have found ways to download from the NPR site over the years, I have gone through and updated the show location for all shows in the Stats Page database.

<strong>*</strong>: Of course, there are a few shows where Carl Kasell didn't say which location a Best Of show was recorded or the venue in which a show was taped from (be it at a public radio station or a location with a live audience).
