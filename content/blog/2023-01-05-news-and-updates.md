Hello, y'all.

I know that I have not posted any posts here in a long time, even though there has been some new releases of the [Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), [Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/), [Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/) and [Stats API](https://api.wwdt.me/) sites since my last post. Even though development has been continuing, I haven't had a lot of time to write out posts detailing those updates. Instead, I have been including change logs in each of the project's Git repository.

Another bit of Stats-related news is that version 1 of the Stats API will be turned off at the end of this month, January 31, 2023. If you are currently using Stats API v1 and want to use Stats API v2, I would highly recommend that you review the "[Wait Wait Stats API v2.0 Changes](https://github.com/questionlp/api.wwdt.me_v2/blob/main/API-CHANGES.md)" document for information on migrating to the new API version. After January 31, 2023, calls made to the Stats API v1 endpoints will return an HTTP status code of 404.

I also made the decision to deactivate my Twitter account and have set up my own presence on out in the fediverse by running my own Mastodon instance. If you are part of the fediverse, you can follow me at [@qlp@linh.social](https://linh.social/@qlp). I have set up a bot account on my instance, [@waitwait_podbot@linh.social](https://linh.social/@waitwait_podbot), that regularly scrapes the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! podcast feed and publishes a new post when a new episode appears.

One last bit of news, I will be publishing new posts and updates on my new blog at [blog.linh.social](https://blog.linh.social/). I will be keeping this site up and running for the foreseeable future.
